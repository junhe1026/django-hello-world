# django "hello world"

## Introduction
This is the *Django* hello world folder that I created when I learned and coded the tutorial in the [official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/). In some part of the code, there may exist slightly differece compared to the original tutorial. These were modified during the learning process when I wanted to explore deeper than the tutorial.
